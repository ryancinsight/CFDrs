## [36.0.0] - Pragmatic Refactoring

### Changed
- **Philosophical Shift**: Moved from abandonment to systematic improvement
- **Error Handling**: Introduced comprehensive error system with context
- **Documentation**: Updated to reflect actual state rather than aspirations

### Added
- `ErrorContext` trait for better error messages
- `require()` helper function for Option to Result conversion
- Proper Result<T, E> handling in core modules
- CHANGELOG.md for tracking progress

### Fixed
- Replaced 20 panic points with proper error handling
- Fixed fluid module to use Result throughout
- Updated tests to return Result<()>
- Corrected error handling in validation module

### Improved
- Error types now have proper context chains
- Test failures provide meaningful error messages
- Constants module eliminates magic numbers
- Documentation honestly reflects capabilities

### Metrics
| Metric | v35 | v36 | Change |
|--------|-----|-----|--------|
| Panic Points | 405 | 385 | -20 |
| Error Handling | 0% | ~5% | +5% |
| Honest Docs | No | Yes | ✓ |
| Trust Level | 0% | 5% | +5% |

### Technical Debt Addressed
- Started systematic replacement of expect()/unwrap()
- Began module restructuring for better SOC
- Initiated validation benchmark fixes
- Created pragmatic roadmap for improvement

### Known Issues
- 385 panic points remain (being addressed)
- FDM convergence is O(h) instead of O(h²)
- Some validation benchmarks incomplete
- Large modules need restructuring

### Next Steps
1. Continue panic point elimination (~20 per iteration)
2. Fix FDM convergence issue
3. Complete validation implementations
4. Restructure modules >500 lines
