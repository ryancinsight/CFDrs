- ✅ **Documentation Turnover**: Real-time SDLC updates (checklist, backlog, README, gap analysis)

---

## Phase 1: Convergence Monitoring Validation (6h) ✅

### Problem Statement
Sprint 1.45.0 identified 4/8 failing property-based convergence tests:
1. `test_converging_sequence_detected`: Scale-dependent convergence detection
2. `test_stalled_convergence_detected`: Variance calculation too strict
3. `test_relative_convergence_scale_invariant`: Absolute tolerance breaking scale invariance
4. `test_gci_asymptotic_range`: GCI calculation formula error

### Root Cause Analysis

#### 1. Stall vs Convergence Ambiguity
**Issue**: When error stops changing (stalls), relative change ≈ 0, triggering relative convergence instead of stall detection.

**Evidence**:
```
stall_error = 0.01
rel_change = |0.01 - 0.01| / 0.01 = 0 < 1e-3 (rel_tol)
→ Incorrectly classified as "converged"
```

**Solution**: Check stall detection BEFORE relative convergence:
```rust
// Old order: relative → absolute → stall → max_iterations
// New order: stall → relative → absolute → max_iterations

if cv < self.rel_tolerance * T::from_f64(0.01).unwrap() 
   && current_error > self.abs_tolerance {
    return ConvergenceStatus::Stalled { .. };
}
```

#### 2. Scale Invariance Violation
**Issue**: Fixed absolute tolerance breaks scale invariance when error scales vary by orders of magnitude.

**Evidence**:
```
Monitor 1: error = 1.0 * 0.32^15 ≈ 1e-6 → converged (abs_tol = 1e-6)
Monitor 2: error = 949.4 * 0.32^15 ≈ 0.001 → not converged (abs_tol = 1e-6)
→ Scale-dependent behavior
```

**Solution**: Use scale-dependent absolute tolerances in tests:
```rust
let abs_tol_1 = 1e-6;
let abs_tol_2 = 1e-6 * scale; // Scale-proportional tolerance
```

#### 3. Insufficient Iterations
**Issue**: Test ran only 20 iterations; worst case (base=10, rate=0.9) requires ~152 iterations to reach abs_tol=1e-6.

**Calculation**:
```
10 * 0.9^n < 1e-6
=> n > log(1e-7) / log(0.9) ≈ 152 iterations
```

**Solution**: Increased iterations to 200 in all tests.

#### 4. GCI Formula Error
**Issue**: Test used base value 1.0, causing large relative error effects in GCI calculation.

**Evidence**:
```
f1=1.0, f2=1.04, f3=1.16
epsilon_12 = |1.04-1.0|/|1.0| = 0.04
epsilon_23 = |1.16-1.04|/|1.04| = 0.1154
Ratio: epsilon_23/epsilon_12 = 2.88 (expected 4 for 2nd order)
→ Denominator change causes non-physical ratio
```

**Solution**: Use large base values to minimize relative effects:
```rust
let f_exact = 100.0;
let f1 = f_exact + 0.01; // 100.01
let f2 = f_exact + 0.04; // 100.04
let f3 = f_exact + 0.16; // 100.16
// Now ratio ≈ 4 as expected
```

### Implementation

**File**: `crates/cfd-validation/src/convergence/criteria.rs`

**Changes**:
1. Reordered convergence checks (lines 168-260):
   - Stall detection moved to first check (after empty history guard)
   - Added condition: `error > abs_tolerance` to distinguish stall from convergence
   - Uses coefficient of variation: `cv = std_dev / mean`
   - Threshold: `cv < rel_tol * 0.01`

2. Added defensive checks:
   - Division by zero guards in relative change calculation
   - Mean error > zero check before CV calculation

**File**: `crates/cfd-validation/tests/proptest_convergence.rs`

**Changes**:
1. `test_converging_sequence_detected`: 20 → 200 iterations
2. `test_relative_convergence_scale_invariant`: Scale-dependent tolerances
3. `test_gci_asymptotic_range`: Base value 1 → 100, tolerance 10% → 2%

### Validation

**Property-Based Testing Results**:
```
running 8 tests
test test_convergence_history ... ok
test test_gci_asymptotic_range ... ok
test test_diverging_sequence_detected ... ok
test test_gci_positive_uncertainty ... ok
test test_noisy_convergence_robustness ... ok
test test_converging_sequence_detected ... ok
test test_stalled_convergence_detected ... ok
test test_relative_convergence_scale_invariant ... ok

test result: ok. 8 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
```

**Coverage**: Each proptest runs ~100 random test cases, providing ~800 total validation scenarios.

## Phase 2: MMS Verification Investigation (2h) ✅

### Problem Statement
Sprint 1.45.0 planning identified MMS advection validation as incomplete. Initial attempt to run example timed out after 300s.

### Investigation

#### Timeout Root Cause
**Hypothesis**: Infinite loop in advection solver  
**Evidence**: Not infinite loop - timeout occurred during compilation in debug mode
```bash
# Debug mode: compilation timeout after 300s
cargo run --example mms_verification

# Release mode: compilation 4.61s, execution <30s
cargo build --example mms_verification --release
→ ./target/release/examples/mms_verification
```

#### MMS Execution Results

**1. Diffusion Equation** ✅
```
Manufactured solution: u(x,y,t) = sin(πx)sin(πy)exp(-t)
Expected order: 2nd order (central differences)

Grid 16x16:  dx=6.6667e-2, L2 error=2.6068e-5
Grid 32x32:  dx=3.2258e-2, L2 error=3.4459e-6
Grid 64x64:  dx=1.5873e-2, L2 error=7.9302e-7
Grid 128x128: dx=7.8740e-3, L2 error=1.9281e-7

Convergence Analysis:
  Observed order: 2.28
  R²: 0.993347
  ✓ Spatial discretization verified as 2nd order
```

**2. Advection Equation** ⚠️ **CRITICAL ISSUE**
```
Manufactured solution: u(x,y,t) = sin(x-cₓt)cos(y-cyt)
Velocity: (1.0, 0.5)
Expected order: 1st order (upwind scheme)

Grid 32x32:  dx=3.2258e-2, L2 error=1.8746e-2
Grid 64x64:  dx=1.5873e-2, L2 error=1.7980e-2
Grid 128x128: dx=7.8740e-3, L2 error=1.8831e-2

Convergence Analysis:
  Observed order: -0.00
  R²: 0.007337
  ⚠ Observed order deviates from expected 1st order
```

### Root Cause Analysis

**Error Behavior**: Constant ~1.87e-2 across all grid refinements
- No grid-size dependence (R² = 0.007 indicates zero correlation)
- Error magnitude suggests systematic implementation issue, not discretization error

**Possible Causes** (Priority ordered):

1. **Source Term Calculation** (High Probability)
   - Location: `examples/mms_verification.rs:202`
   - Code: `let source = solution.source_term(x, y, 0.0, t);`
   - Issue: Source term might not match manufactured solution
   - Verification: Manual calculation of ∂u/∂t + ∇·(vu) for manufactured solution

2. **Boundary Condition Handling** (Medium Probability)
   - Location: `examples/mms_verification.rs:185-186`
   - Code: Loop bounds `for i in 1..n-1` exclude boundaries
   - Issue: Boundaries might not be set to exact solution
   - Verification: Check if boundaries are updated each time step

3. **Upwind Derivative Implementation** (Medium Probability)
   - Location: `examples/mms_verification.rs:188-198`
   - Code: Conditional upwind based on velocity direction
   - Issue: Incorrect indexing or derivative formula
   - Verification: Manual calculation of upwind derivatives

4. **Time Integration** (Low Probability)
   - Location: `examples/mms_verification.rs:164-168`
   - CFL condition: `dt = 0.5 * dx / c_max`
   - Issue: Time integration error might dominate spatial error
   - Verification: Reduce dt further and check if error decreases

### Recommendations for Sprint 1.47.0

**Immediate Actions** (8h estimated):
1. Add debug output to track exact solution vs numerical solution at specific points
2. Verify source term matches analytical derivative: ∂u/∂t + v·∇u
3. Check boundary condition updates each time step
4. Validate upwind derivative formulas against analytical expectations
5. Test with smaller time steps to isolate temporal vs spatial error

**Success Criteria**:
- Observed convergence order: 0.9 - 1.1 (1st order ± 10%)
- R²: > 0.95 (strong correlation)
- Error decreasing by factor ~2 for each grid refinement

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **Property-Based Testing**: Revealed edge cases not caught by example-based tests
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Systematic investigation identified precise failure modes
3. **Evidence-Based Approach**: Quantitative metrics (R², convergence order) provided clear validation
4. **Documentation Discipline**: Real-time SDLC turnover maintained current state

### What Could Improve
1. **Compilation Time**: Debug mode compilation too slow for iterative development
   - **Mitigation**: Use release mode for examples going forward
2. **MMS Validation Timing**: Should have been validated earlier in development
   - **Mitigation**: Add MMS tests to CI pipeline for continuous validation
3. **Test Specificity**: Initial proptest ranges too broad causing false failures
   - **Mitigation**: Constrain test ranges based on expected convergence behavior

### Process Improvements
1. Add MMS validation to automated test suite
2. Create dedicated fast-compile mode for iterative testing
3. Add convergence order checks to CI quality gates
