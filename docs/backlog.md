# CFD Suite Backlog

## Sprint 1.91.0: Advanced Validation Framework Expansion
**Status**: In Progress
**Start Date**: November 2, 2025

### Sprint Objectives
- Extend Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS) test coverage for complex geometries
- Implement Richardson extrapolation automation for error analysis
- Add performance benchmarking framework for production scaling validation
- Enhance validation suite with comprehensive error metrics and convergence studies

### Sprint Backlog Items

#### MMS Test Coverage Expansion
- [x] **MMS-001**: Implement MMS for non-rectangular domains (circular, annular geometries) - Tasks 1.1, 1.2 & 1.3 COMPLETED
- [ ] **MMS-002**: Add MMS validation for complex boundary conditions (mixed BC types)
- [ ] **MMS-003**: Extend MMS to turbulent flow regimes with manufactured turbulence quantities
- [ ] **MMS-004**: Implement MMS for multi-physics coupling (heat transfer, species transport)

#### Richardson Extrapolation Automation
- [x] **RE-001**: Create Richardson extrapolation core library for grid convergence studies ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **RE-002**: Implement automated grid refinement strategies (geometric progression) ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **RE-003**: Add error estimation and convergence rate calculation ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **RE-004**: Integrate Richardson extrapolation with existing MMS framework ✅ COMPLETED

#### Performance Benchmarking Framework
- [ ] **PB-001**: Design comprehensive benchmarking suite for CFD operations
- [ ] **PB-002**: Implement memory usage profiling and optimization tracking
- [ ] **PB-003**: Add parallel scaling analysis for multi-core/multi-GPU configurations
- [ ] **PB-004**: Create performance regression detection and alerting

#### Validation Infrastructure
- [ ] **VI-001**: Enhance validation test organization with clear taxonomy
- [ ] **VI-002**: Implement automated validation report generation (HTML/PDF)
- [ ] **VI-003**: Add validation metrics dashboard and visualization
- [ ] **VI-004**: Create validation configuration management system

### Completed Items
- [x] **PRE-001**: Resolve all build, test, and example errors (except known SIMPLEC convergence issues)
- [x] **PRE-002**: Clean up compiler warnings and code quality issues
- [x] **PRE-003**: Fix boundary condition handling in momentum solver

### Known Issues
- **SIMPLEC Convergence**: SIMPLEC/PIMPLE solver has matrix construction issues resolved, but pressure Poisson system remains singular due to incorrect reference pressure handling. Requires deeper investigation of boundary condition implementation and pressure-velocity coupling algorithm.
- **GPU Feature Gaps**: Some GPU-related code is unused due to feature flag configuration

### Sprint Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain >80% coverage across all crates
- **Performance**: No regression in benchmark performance
- **Code Quality**: Zero warnings, comprehensive documentation
- **Validation**: All new MMS tests pass with expected convergence rates
