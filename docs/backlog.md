**Status**: Completed
**Start Date**: Next

### Sprint Objectives
- Enable mathematical modeling of distinct cellular injury zones (lysis, necrosis, permeabilization) from hydrodynamic cavitation in micro-orifices.
- Implement stiffness-coupled heterogeneous nucleation to predict altered cavitation inception times for Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs).
- Provide unified mathematical specifications and zero-cost `GhostCell` topological integration for the new physics models.

- [x] **HCOC-008**: Replace `cfd-2d` turbulence benchmark placeholder dispatch with a closed supported-model registry.
- [x] **HCOC-009**: Restore coupled cfd-1d blood pressure-event solves with finite startup viscosity and row-equilibrated hydraulic linear systems.
- [x] **HCOC-010**: Replace compact `cfd-1d` plasma-skimming screening with the threshold-aware Pries phase-separation model and Murray-inferred sibling geometry.
- [x] **HCOC-011**: Replace `cfd-2d` serpentine mixing's exponential estimate with the Neumann transverse-diffusion eigenfunction solution.
- [x] **HCOC-012**: Replace `cfd-3d` LES turbulent-kinetic-energy viscosity aliases with a shared Yoshizawa SGS energy relation.
- [x] **HCOC-013**: Remove silent clamps from `cfd-2d` Pries plasma-skimming and add checked physical-envelope regression tests.
- [x] **HCOC-014**: Replace `cfd-2d` WALE boundary zero-gradient reductions with second-order one-sided gradient stencils.
- [x] **HCOC-015**: Replace `cfd-3d` Spalart-Allmaras all-zero TKE output with a wall-distance Yoshizawa diagnostic.
- [x] **HCOC-016**: Reject uninitialized `cfd-3d` k-epsilon state instead of synthesizing zero turbulence fields.
- [x] **HCOC-017**: Replace `cfd-2d` Smagorinsky LES zero SGS energy/dissipation placeholders with Yoshizawa diagnostics and second-order boundary strain.
- [x] **HCOC-018**: Remove the `cfd-1d` margination singular wall cutoff and silent lateral-position clamp while preserving inertial-lift scaling tests.
- [x] **HCOC-019**: Remove stored `cfd-1d` droplet occupied-channel state so finite-length occupancy spans are the only authoritative representation.
- [x] **HCOC-020**: Remove residual `cfd-2d` Smagorinsky validation SGS floors and keep LES validation on physical zero-floor defaults.
- [x] **HCOC-021**: Correct Milestone 12 cross-track therapy utility so ultrasound-only SDT receives acoustic-cavitation delivery credit from channel resonance, cancer-center enrichment, and active therapy-zone fraction.
