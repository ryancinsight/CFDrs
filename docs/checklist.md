### Remaining Technical Debt ⚠️
- [ ] 24 modules still exceed 300 lines (aggregates.rs: 408 next)
- [ ] Wall distance calculation limited to channel flows
- [ ] Some documentation warnings remain
- [ ] 23 documentation warnings remain (field/variant docs)
- [ ] No SIMD/parallelization implemented
- [ ] No benchmarks for performance validation
- [ ] Cannot run nextest due to csgrs edition2024 requirement

### Planned ❌
- [ ] Parallelization and profiling
- [ ] SIMD/SWAR where safe and portable
- [ ] CI with lint + test matrix
- [ ] Property-based/fuzz testing

## Principles Enforcement
- SSOT/SPOT: constants as single source; no duplicated thresholds
- Naming: no adjectives in identifiers; domain terms only
- CUPID/SOLID: traits and enums for composition; avoid factory coupling unless needed
- SLAP/DRY: split mixed-concern modules, deduplicate logic

## Risk Assessment
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Incorrect physics | Medium | High | Expand validation set |
| Runtime panic | Low | Medium | Replace unwrap/expect, tests |
| Performance gaps | High | Medium | Profile, parallelize hot paths |

## Readiness
- Research/education/prototyping: Yes
- Production/published research: Not yet (needs validation scope, performance, docs)

## Next Milestones
1. Split `cfd-core/time.rs` into `time/integrators.rs` and `time/controllers.rs` (done)
2. Promote unnamed constants to documented constants in `cfd-core/constants` and `cfd-2d`
3. Add MMS tests for diffusion/advection; expand Poiseuille pipe case
4. CI: build + test + fmt + clippy gates
