# Turbulence, Multiphase, and Cavitation

CFDrs models three coupled physical regimes: **turbulence** (RANS / LES
closures), **multiphase flows** (phases with distinct equations of state),
and **cavitation** (liquid–vapour phase transition at low pressure).
This chapter documents the integration contracts used to combine them.

## Turbulence Closures

`cfd-3d` integrates the canonical closures through a single trait:

```rust
pub trait TurbulenceModel {
    type Field;
    fn step<F: FloatElement>(&mut self, u: &Array3<F>, v: &Array3<F>, w: &Array3<F>,
                             nu_t: &mut Array3<F>, dt: F);
    fn label(&self) -> &'static str;
}
```

CFDrs distributes three models:

| Model | Crate | Trait impl |
|---|---|---|
| Standard k-ε | `cfd-3d` | `KEpsilon` |
| k-ω SST | `cfd-3d` | `KOmegaSST` |
| Smagorinsky LES | `cfd-3d` | `Smagorinsky` |

The closure returns a **turbulent viscosity** `ν_t` per cell that the
momentum solver applies as an additional diffusion term.

## Multiphase Coupling

For multiphase (e.g. liquid + gas), CFDrs uses a **volume-of-fluid**
style coupling: each cell carries a phase-volume fraction `α ∈ [0, 1]`,
and mixture properties are computed by a weighted sum:

```rust
let rho_mix = rho_l * (1.0 - alpha) + rho_g * alpha;
let mu_mix  = mu_l  * (1.0 - alpha) + mu_g  * alpha;
```

The `MomentumCoupling` enum selects between *co-located* and *staggered*
schemes; SSE-style momentum exchange is supported through
[`cfd_3d::multiphase::exchange`].

## Cavitation Physics

Cavitation is modeled as a **phase transition** whose rate depends on
local pressure-vs-vapor-pressure:

```rust
pub trait Cavitation {
    fn inception_pressure<F: FloatElement>(&self) -> F;
    fn collapse_rate<F: FloatElement>(&self, p: F) -> F;
}
```

The default model is a **Rayleigh–Plesset** closure; an
**Eulerian–Eulerian** variant is available for strong cloud-cavitation
flows.

Damage accumulation is integrated per timestep as

  damage += (inception_indicator) · (collapse_rate · dt)

and reported through the [`cfd-3d::posterior::damage`] hook.  Outputs are
dimensionally consistent (kg/m²/s) so that downstream fatigue models can
post-process without re-scaling.

## Integration Contract

All three regimes compose through the same `Integrate` trait:

```rust
pub trait Integrate {
    fn step<F: FloatElement>(&mut self) -> Result<(), CfdError>;
}
```

The implementation multiplexes the closure choice at the cavity-call site.
This makes regime switching a configuration-change, not a code rewrite.
