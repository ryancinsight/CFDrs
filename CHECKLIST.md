## Key Insights

### What Worked Well
1. Systematic error fixing in cfd-math
2. Creating proper error types for cfd-mesh
3. Centralizing constants
4. Unblocking dependent modules

### Challenges Encountered
1. cfd-1d has deep ownership issues
2. Module dependency revealed more errors
3. Some modules lack proper error handling

### Lessons Learned
1. Fix foundational modules first
2. Proper error types prevent cascading issues
3. Constants should be centralized early
4. Module dependencies can hide error counts

## Final Assessment

**Project Status: 50% Functional**

The project has made **significant progress** with half of all modules now compiling. The core foundation is solid, mathematical operations work, and mesh handling is functional. The remaining issues are primarily in the solver modules (1D, 2D, 3D) which have typical Rust ownership challenges that are solvable with focused effort.

**Recommendation**: Continue development - the project is viable and well-architected.
