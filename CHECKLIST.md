# CFD Suite - Technical Checklist

## Version 0.57.4 - Current State

### Completed ✅
- [x] Workspace builds without errors
- [x] All tests pass (workspace)
- [x] Examples compile and run
- [x] Memory safety (Rust)
- [x] Result-based error handling
- [x] Analytical validations: Couette, Poiseuille (plates), Taylor-Green
- [x] Removed placeholder CSG constructor
- [x] Fixed benches: iterator trait import, Poiseuille API, sparse matvec
- [x] Propagated sparse matrix builder errors (no ignored results)
- [x] Per-cell viscosity in 2D momentum; completed boundary handling
- [x] Removed external CSG example stubs
- [x] Module refactoring: Split `cfd-1d/resistance.rs` (705 LOC) into domain-based submodules
- [x] Replaced adjective-based variable names (u_old→u_current, _temp→descriptive names)
- [x] Replaced magic numbers with named constants throughout codebase
- [x] Added proper setters to Network for state updates

### In Progress ⚠️
- [ ] Module refactoring: `cfd-3d/level_set.rs` (719 LOC), `cfd-validation/numerical_validation.rs` (721 LOC) still need splitting
- [ ] Documentation for all public constants and fields
- [ ] Expand physics validation set (MMS, benchmark datasets)

### Planned ❌
- [ ] Parallelization and profiling
- [ ] SIMD/SWAR where safe and portable
- [ ] CI with lint + test matrix
- [ ] Property-based/fuzz testing

## Principles Enforcement
- SSOT/SPOT: ✅ Constants centralized in `cfd-core/constants`; no duplicated thresholds
- Naming: ✅ No adjectives in identifiers; domain terms only (fixed all _old/_new/_temp)
- CUPID/SOLID: ✅ Traits and enums for composition; resistance module properly modularized
- SLAP/DRY: ✅ Split mixed-concern modules (resistance.rs → 5 focused submodules)
- Zero-copy: ✅ Using references and slices where possible
- Magic Numbers: ✅ All replaced with named constants

## Risk Assessment
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Incorrect physics | Medium | High | Expand validation set |
| Runtime panic | Low | Medium | Replace unwrap/expect, tests |
| Performance gaps | High | Medium | Profile, parallelize hot paths |

## Readiness
- Research/education/prototyping: Yes
- Production/published research: Not yet (needs broader validation, performance optimization, complete docs)

## Next Milestones
1. ✅ Split `cfd-1d/resistance.rs` into modular structure
2. ✅ Replace all adjective-based naming patterns
3. ✅ Promote magic numbers to documented constants
4. Add MMS tests for diffusion/advection; expand Poiseuille pipe case
5. CI: build + test + fmt + clippy gates
