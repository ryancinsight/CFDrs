- [x] Added mesh helper methods (get_element_vertices, get_element_faces)
- [x] Strengthened tests with quantitative assertions
- [x] Validated Hagen-Poiseuille implementation against theory (within 1%)
- [x] Fixed all unused variable warnings with proper implementations

### Planned ❌
- [ ] Parallelization and profiling
- [ ] SIMD/SWAR where safe and portable
- [ ] CI with lint + test matrix
- [ ] Property-based/fuzz testing

## Principles Enforcement
- SSOT/SPOT: constants as single source; no duplicated thresholds
- Naming: no adjectives in identifiers; domain terms only
- CUPID/SOLID: traits and enums for composition; avoid factory coupling unless needed
- SLAP/DRY: split mixed-concern modules, deduplicate logic

## Risk Assessment
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Incorrect physics | Medium | High | Expand validation set |
| Runtime panic | Low | Medium | Replace unwrap/expect, tests |
| Performance gaps | High | Medium | Profile, parallelize hot paths |

## Readiness
- Research/education/prototyping: Yes
- Production/published research: Not yet (needs validation scope, performance, docs)

## Next Milestones
1. Split `cfd-core/time.rs` into `time/integrators.rs` and `time/controllers.rs` (done)
2. Promote unnamed constants to documented constants in `cfd-core/constants` and `cfd-2d`
3. Add MMS tests for diffusion/advection; expand Poiseuille pipe case
4. CI: build + test + fmt + clippy gates
