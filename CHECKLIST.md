## Priority Tasks
1. Fix example code
2. Split large modules
3. Add performance benchmarks
4. Complete documentation
5. Optimize critical paths

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Core algorithms (validated)
- Memory safety (Rust)
- Type safety (strong)

### Medium Risk
- Performance (unoptimized)
- Maintainability (large modules)

## Recommendation

**USE FOR:**
- Research projects
- Educational purposes
- Prototyping
- Non-critical simulations

**DO NOT USE FOR:**
- Safety-critical systems
- High-performance production
- Commercial products without additional validation
