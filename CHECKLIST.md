## Improvement Plan

### Phase 1: Documentation (Quick Wins)
- [ ] Add missing documentation for constants
- [ ] Document struct fields
- [ ] Add module-level documentation
- [ ] Create usage examples

### Phase 2: Code Quality
- [ ] Replace magic numbers with named constants
- [ ] Review error handling patterns
- [ ] Ensure consistent naming conventions
- [ ] Apply clippy suggestions

### Phase 3: Testing
- [ ] Increase test coverage to >80%
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Add property-based tests
- [ ] Validate physics accuracy

### Phase 4: Performance
- [ ] Profile hot paths
- [ ] Apply zero-copy optimizations
- [ ] Consider SIMD opportunities
- [ ] Optimize memory allocations

## Design Principles Compliance

| Principle | Current | Target | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
| SOLID | Good | Excellent | ✅ |
| DRY | Good | Excellent | ✅ |
| KISS | Good | Good | ✅ |
| Zero-copy | Partial | Full | ⚠️ |
| Type Safety | Excellent | Excellent | ✅ |

## Technical Debt

### Low Priority
- Documentation completeness
- Some test code uses magic numbers
- Could use more comprehensive benchmarks

### No Critical Issues ✅
- No memory safety issues
- No architectural problems
- No blocking bugs

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Documentation Warnings** (30 min)
   - Add missing docs for public items
   - Will eliminate all warnings

2. **Enhance Test Coverage** (2 hours)
   - Add unit tests for edge cases
   - Add integration tests

3. **Performance Profiling** (1 hour)
   - Identify bottlenecks
   - Plan optimizations

4. **Code Review** (2 hours)
   - Apply clippy suggestions
   - Ensure best practices

## Success Metrics

- ✅ **Builds**: 100% success
- ✅ **Tests**: 100% passing
- ⚠️ **Docs**: 90% complete (24 warnings)
- ✅ **Quality**: Good architecture
- ✅ **Maintainability**: High

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Breaking changes | Low | High | Incremental changes only |
| Performance regression | Low | Medium | Benchmark before/after |
| Documentation drift | Medium | Low | Update as we go |

## Conclusion

The codebase is in a **healthy, working state**. We have a solid foundation to build upon with incremental improvements. No critical issues or blockers exist.
