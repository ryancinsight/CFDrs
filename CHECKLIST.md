# CFD Suite Development Checklist

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### Architecture & Design
- [x] Domain-driven module organization
- [x] Clean architecture implementation
- [x] SOLID principles applied
- [x] Separation of concerns
- [x] Trait-based abstractions

### Code Quality
- [x] Removed adjective-based naming
- [x] Replaced magic numbers with constants
- [x] Fixed temporal variable names
- [x] Module reorganization completed
- [ ] Warning reduction (158 warnings remain)

### Build & Testing
- [x] Core modules compile
- [x] 45 unit tests passing (100%)
- [x] Test framework functional
- [x] 8 core examples working
- [ ] CSG feature broken

## üìä Current Metrics

| Metric | Status | Details |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Compilation** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Core works, CSG feature broken |
| **Tests** | ‚úÖ 100% | All 45 tests pass |
| **Examples** | ‚ùå 44% | Only 8/18 working |
| **Warnings** | ‚ùå 158 | Too high, needs reduction |
| **Code Quality** | ‚ö†Ô∏è B- | Good structure, high warnings |

## üéØ Reality Check

### What Actually Works
- **1D Solvers**: Fully functional with validation
- **2D Solvers**: All methods working (FDM, FVM, LBM)
- **Core Examples**: 8 demonstrations functional
- **Tests**: All 45 passing consistently

### What's Actually Broken
- **CSG Feature**: Complete compilation failure
- **6 CSG Examples**: Cannot compile with feature
- **4 Examples**: API mismatches and incomplete features
- **Warning Count**: 158 is unacceptable for production

## üìà Development Status

### ‚úÖ Complete (40%)
- [x] Core architecture
- [x] 1D network solvers
- [x] 2D grid methods
- [x] Basic 3D structure
- [x] Test framework

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial (30%)
- [ ] 3D implementations (basic only)
- [ ] Example coverage (44%)
- [ ] Documentation (missing details)
- [ ] Error handling (some panics remain)

### ‚ùå Broken/Missing (30%)
- [ ] CSG integration
- [ ] Parallel computing
- [ ] GPU acceleration
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Production hardening

## üîß Working Examples (8/18)

### ‚úÖ Actually Working
1. simple_pipe_flow
2. pipe_flow_1d
3. pipe_flow_1d_validation
4. pipe_flow_validation
5. 2d_heat_diffusion
6. spectral_3d_poisson
7. spectral_performance
8. scheme_integration_demo

### ‚ùå Broken (10/18)
- 6 CSG examples (feature compilation error)
- benchmark_validation (API issues)
- fem_3d_stokes (incomplete)
- validation_suite (API mismatch)
- venturi_cavitation (incomplete)

## üìä Quality Assessment

### Honest Grade: C+
- **Architecture**: A (well-designed)
- **Implementation**: C (44% examples work)
- **Testing**: B (good coverage)
- **Documentation**: C (overly optimistic)
- **Warnings**: D (158 is too many)

### Critical Issues
1. CSG feature completely broken
2. 158 warnings indicate poor code hygiene
3. Only 44% example coverage
4. Documentation was misleading

## üöÄ What's Needed for Production

### Must Fix (2-3 weeks)
- [ ] Fix CSG compilation errors
- [ ] Reduce warnings to < 20
- [ ] Fix remaining 10 examples
- [ ] Complete 3D implementations

### Should Have (1-2 months)
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Parallel computing
- [ ] Comprehensive benchmarks
- [ ] Integration tests

### Nice to Have (3+ months)
- [ ] GPU acceleration
- [ ] Advanced turbulence
- [ ] Real-time simulation
- [ ] HPC support

## üìù Verification Commands

```bash
# What works
cargo build --workspace  # ‚úì
cargo test --workspace --lib  # ‚úì 45 tests

# What's broken
cargo build --workspace --features csg  # ‚úó FAILS

# Reality check
for e in examples/*.rs; do
    cargo build --example $(basename $e .rs) 2>/dev/null && echo "‚úì"
done | wc -l  # Returns: 8 (not 12!)

# Warning count
cargo build --workspace 2>&1 | grep "warning:" | wc -l  # 158
```

## üèÅ Honest Summary

**Status**: PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL
**Quality**: C+ (Below production standards)
**Usability**: 1D/2D only, avoid CSG
**Timeline**: 2-3 months to production

### The Truth
- ‚úÖ 1D/2D solvers work well
- ‚úÖ Clean architecture
- ‚ùå CSG completely broken
- ‚ùå 56% of examples don't work
- ‚ùå 158 warnings is unprofessional

### Recommendation
Use for 1D/2D CFD research only. Not production-ready. Significant work needed on CSG integration, warning reduction, and example coverage.
