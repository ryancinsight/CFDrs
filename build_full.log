  feature `edition2024` is required

  The package requires the Cargo feature called `edition2024`, but that feature is not stabilized in this version of Cargo (1.82.0 (8f40fc59f 2024-08-21)).
  Consider trying a newer version of Cargo (this may require the nightly release).
  See https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#edition-2024 for more information about the status of this feature.
