# CFD Suite - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

CFD Suite is a partially functional computational fluid dynamics library in Rust. While the architecture is clean and 1D/2D solvers work, significant issues remain: CSG feature is completely broken, only 44% of examples work, and there are 158 warnings. The project is approximately 60% complete and not production-ready.

## Current Status: PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL

### Actual Metrics
```rust
impl ProjectStatus {
    fn reality_check() -> Status {
        Status {
            compilation: PartialSuccess, // Core works, CSG broken
            tests: Passing(45),         // 100% pass rate
            examples: Working(8, 18),    // 44% success rate
            warnings: Critical(158),     // Unacceptable
            production_ready: 0.60       // Not ready
        }
    }
}
```

## Critical Issues

### üî¥ Blockers
1. **CSG Feature Broken**: cfd-mesh fails compilation with CSG enabled
2. **High Warning Count**: 158 warnings indicate poor code hygiene
3. **Low Example Coverage**: Only 44% (8/18) examples work
4. **Incomplete Implementations**: FEM, spectral methods partial

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Major Problems
- 6 examples require broken CSG feature
- 4 examples have API mismatches
- No parallel computing
- No performance optimization
- Documentation was overly optimistic

## What Actually Works

### ‚úÖ Functional (40%)
- 1D network solvers with validation
- 2D grid methods (FDM, FVM, LBM)
- 45 unit tests (all passing)
- 8 core examples
- Clean architecture

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial (30%)
- 3D solvers (basic structure only)
- Documentation (misleading in places)
- Error handling (some panics remain)
- Mesh generation (broken with CSG)

### ‚ùå Broken (30%)
- CSG integration completely
- 10 of 18 examples
- Performance optimization
- Parallel computing
- GPU acceleration

## Quality Assessment

### Honest Grades
```rust
struct QualityMetrics {
    architecture: Grade::A,      // Well-designed
    implementation: Grade::C,    // 44% examples work
    testing: Grade::B,          // Good coverage
    documentation: Grade::C,    // Was misleading
    code_hygiene: Grade::D,     // 158 warnings
    overall: Grade::C_PLUS      // Below standards
}
```

## Use Cases

### Safe to Use
- 1D pipe flow networks
- 2D heat transfer
- Educational demonstrations
- Research prototypes

### Do Not Use
- Production systems
- CSG-based workflows
- 3D simulations
- Commercial applications
- Safety-critical systems

## Development Requirements

### Must Fix (2-3 weeks)
1. Fix CSG compilation errors
2. Reduce warnings to < 20
3. Fix 10 broken examples
4. Complete 3D implementations

### Should Have (1-2 months)
1. Performance optimization
2. Parallel computing
3. Comprehensive benchmarks
4. Integration tests

### Nice to Have (3+ months)
1. GPU acceleration
2. Advanced turbulence models
3. Real-time simulation
4. HPC support

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- CSG feature may require major refactoring
- 158 warnings suggest systemic issues
- Only 44% example coverage is concerning
- Documentation credibility damaged

### Mitigation Strategy
1. Disable CSG feature until fixed
2. Warning reduction sprint
3. API compatibility audit
4. Documentation reality check

## Timeline to Production

### Current State: 60% Complete

#### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (2-3 weeks)
- Fix CSG compilation
- Reduce warnings < 50
- Fix broken examples

#### Phase 2: Completion (1-2 months)
- Finish 3D implementations
- Add parallelism
- Performance optimization

#### Phase 3: Production (2-3 months)
- Comprehensive testing
- Security audit
- Documentation overhaul
- Release preparation

**Realistic Timeline: 3-4 months minimum**

## Technical Debt

### Immediate Concerns
- 158 warnings (unacceptable)
- CSG feature completely broken
- 56% of examples don't work
- Misleading documentation

### Long-term Issues
- No parallel computing
- No GPU support
- Incomplete 3D solvers
- Missing benchmarks

## Recommendations

### For Users
- **DO**: Use for 1D/2D research only
- **DON'T**: Use CSG features
- **DON'T**: Use in production
- **EXPECT**: Breaking changes

### For Management
- **Investment Required**: 3-4 months
- **Risk Level**: High
- **Current Value**: Limited (research only)
- **Production Ready**: No

### For Contributors
- Priority 1: Fix CSG compilation
- Priority 2: Reduce warnings
- Priority 3: Fix examples
- Priority 4: Complete 3D

## Honest Assessment

### The Good
- Clean architecture (A grade)
- 1D/2D solvers work well
- All tests pass
- 8 examples functional

### The Bad
- CSG completely broken
- 158 warnings
- Only 44% examples work
- Documentation misleading

### The Ugly
- Not production-ready
- 3-4 months from release
- Significant technical debt
- Trust issues with documentation

## Conclusion

CFD Suite is a partially functional library that works for basic 1D/2D CFD but has significant issues preventing production use. The CSG feature is completely broken, affecting 6 examples. With 158 warnings and only 44% example coverage, the project needs substantial work before it can be considered production-ready.

### Final Verdict
- **Grade**: C+ (Partially functional)
- **Status**: 60% complete
- **Production Ready**: NO
- **Recommendation**: Research use only

### Required Actions
1. Fix CSG immediately
2. Reduce warnings to acceptable levels
3. Fix all examples
4. Update documentation honestly
