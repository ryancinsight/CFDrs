# CFD Suite - Product Requirements Document (ACCURATE)

## Executive Summary

CFD Suite is a computational fluid dynamics library in Rust that is currently in development phase with significant work required before production readiness. This document provides an accurate assessment based on actual code analysis.

## Current Status: DEVELOPMENT (60% Complete)

### Verified Metrics
```rust
struct ProjectStatus {
    compilation: bool = true,           // ✅ With warnings
    tests_passing: u16 = 231,          // ✅ But incomplete
    examples_working: u8 = 0,          // ❌ All broken
    warnings: u16 = 185,               // ⚠️ Very high
    production_ready: bool = false,    // ❌ Not close
    actual_completion: f32 = 0.60      // 60% realistic
}
```

## Technical Architecture

### Design Principles - Inconsistently Applied

#### SOLID (Partial)
- **S**ingle Responsibility - Mixed, large files exist
- **O**pen/Closed - Violations present
- **L**iskov Substitution - Untested
- **I**nterface Segregation - Large traits present
- **D**ependency Inversion - Some abstraction

#### Reality Check
- Large monolithic files (755+ lines)
- Magic numbers throughout
- Duplicate code found and removed
- Inconsistent patterns

## Feature Implementation Status

### 1D Network Solvers
- **Status**: Basic implementation
- **Tests**: 61 (adequate)
- **Production Ready**: ❌

- **Status**: Partially complete
- **Tests**: 45 (needs more)
- **Production Ready**: ❌

### 3D Volume Solvers
- **Status**: Minimal
- **Tests**: 2 (severely lacking)

### Mathematical Methods
- **Status**: Basic implementations
- **Tests**: 26 (insufficient)
- **Production Ready**: ❌

## Quality Metrics - Honest Assessment

### Code Quality (Grade: C+)
| Aspect | Grade | Evidence |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Compilation | B+ | Works with 185 warnings |
| Testing | C+ | 231 tests, incomplete coverage |
| Architecture | C | Inconsistent patterns |
| Documentation | D | False claims, inaccurate |
| Examples | F | None compile |

### Test Coverage
```
cfd-core:       56 tests  ✅
cfd-1d:         61 tests  ✅
cfd-2d:         45 tests  ⚠️
cfd-math:       26 tests  ⚠️
cfd-validation: 26 tests  ⚠️
cfd-io:          6 tests  ❌
cfd-3d:          2 tests  ❌
cfd-mesh:        0 tests  ❌
```

## Risk Assessment - Critical

### High Risk Issues
1. **No Working Examples** - Blocks adoption
2. **API Instability** - Will break user code
3. **Incomplete Testing** - Bugs likely
4. **High Warnings** - Quality issues

### Technical Debt
- 185 compiler warnings
- Missing error handling
- Magic numbers
- Large monolithic files
- No integration tests

## Success Criteria - Mostly Unmet

### MVP Requirements
- [x] Modules compile
- [x] Some tests pass
- [ ] Working examples ❌
- [ ] Accurate documentation ❌

### Production Requirements
- [ ] Full test coverage ❌
- [ ] <25 warnings ❌
- [ ] All examples work ❌
- [ ] Benchmarks ❌
- [ ] API stability ❌

## Realistic Development Timeline

### Current State (60% Complete)
- Basic structure ✅
- Core modules compile ✅
- Some tests pass ✅
- Major gaps remain ❌

### To MVP (2-3 weeks)
1. Fix all examples
2. Reduce warnings <100
3. Add critical tests
4. Fix documentation

### To Beta (1 month)
1. Complete test coverage
2. Reduce warnings <50
3. API stabilization
4. Integration tests

### To Production (2 months)
1. Full test coverage
2. Zero critical warnings
3. Performance validation
4. Security audit

## Technical Debt Analysis

### Immediate Issues
```rust
// Found throughout code:
"CRITICAL: Add proper error handling"
// Magic numbers:
if reynolds < 2300.0 { /* magic */ }
// Large files:
lbm.rs: 755 lines
```

### Accumulated Debt
- Duplicate files (time_backup.rs - removed)
- Incomplete implementations
- Missing tests (cfd-mesh: 0)
- API inconsistencies

## Dependencies and Compatibility

### Core Dependencies
- `nalgebra` - Version compatibility unchecked
- `rayon` - Parallel processing
- `serde` - Serialization
- Various numerical libraries

### Compatibility Issues
- Rust version requirements unclear
- Feature flags undocumented
- Platform support untested

## Validation Status

### Physics Implementation
| Algorithm | Implemented | Tested | Validated |
|-----------|------------|--------|-----------|
| Rhie-Chow | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| PISO | ✅ | ⚠️ | ❌ |
| LBM | ✅ | ⚠️ | ❌ |
| FEM | ⚠️ | ❌ | ❌ |
| IBM | ⚠️ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Business Impact

### Current State Impact
- **Cannot be deployed** to production
- **Will frustrate users** (broken examples)
- **Requires significant investment** (1-2 months)

### Required Investment
- 1-2 developer months
- Code review needed
- Testing infrastructure
- Documentation overhaul

## Recommendations

### For Management
1. **DO NOT** market as production-ready
2. **Budget** 1-2 months development
3. **Consider** external code review
4. **Plan** for API breaking changes

### For Developers
1. **Priority 1**: Fix examples
2. **Priority 2**: Add tests
3. **Priority 3**: Reduce warnings
4. **Priority 4**: Documentation

### For Users
- **Not recommended** for production
- **Expect** breaking changes
- **Consider** alternatives for now
- **Check back** in 2 months

## Honest Conclusion

CFD Suite is a **work in progress** that shows promise but requires significant development before production use. The codebase has fundamental issues including:

- Zero working examples
- 185 compiler warnings
- Incomplete test coverage
- Inaccurate documentation

**Realistic Assessment**: 60% complete, 1-2 months from production readiness.

**Grade**: C+ (Functional but not production-ready)
