# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## CFD Simulation Suite

### Executive Summary
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation suite implementing numerical methods with modular architecture and performance optimizations.

### Product Vision
Deliver a modular CFD framework with validated numerical accuracy, emphasizing clean architecture, zero-copy patterns where feasible, and extensible design through trait-based abstractions.

### Core Requirements

#### 1. Physics Accuracy
- **Navier-Stokes Solvers**: SIMPLE, PISO algorithms with Rhie-Chow interpolation
- **Discretization Schemes**: Central, Upwind, Power Law, QUICK (Leonard 1979)
- **Turbulence Models**: k-ε, k-ω SST (partial implementation)
- **Multiphase**: VOF, Level Set foundations
- **Validation**: References to Patankar (1980), Versteeg & Malalasekera (2007)

#### 2. Performance
- **Memory Efficiency**: Iterator-based field access, slice returns where possible
- **SIMD**: Architecture-conditional with SWAR fallback (unified implementation)
- **GPU**: wgpu-rs infrastructure (feature-gated, requires testing)
- **Parallelization**: Rayon for CPU parallelization

#### 3. Architecture
- **Modular Design**: 8 specialized crates (core, 1D, 2D, 3D, math, mesh, io, validation)
- **Plugin System**: Trait-based extensibility
- **Design Principles**: SOLID, CUPID, SSOT enforcement
- **Module Size**: Target <500 lines per module (mostly achieved)

#### 4. Numerical Methods
- **Linear Solvers**: CG, BiCGSTAB with preconditioning
- **Time Integration**: Explicit/Implicit Euler, RK4
- **Mesh Support**: Structured grids, unstructured foundations
- **Spectral Methods**: Chebyshev, Fourier bases (3D module)

### Technical Specifications

#### Supported Simulations
- 1D: Pipe networks, microfluidics
- 2D: Lid-driven cavity, channel flow, heat transfer
- 3D: FEM Stokes, spectral Poisson foundations

#### Performance Status
- Memory: Some clone operations remain (112 instances identified)
- SIMD: Unified implementation with AVX2/SSE/NEON/SWAR support
- GPU: Infrastructure present, requires activation and testing

#### Platform Support
- OS: Linux, Windows, macOS
- GPU: wgpu-compatible (Vulkan, Metal, DX12) - untested
- CPU: x86_64 (AVX2), aarch64 (NEON), fallback SWAR

### Quality Assurance
- **Testing**: Unit tests present, integration tests needed
- **Documentation**: API docs incomplete, physics references partial
- **Error Handling**: Result types used throughout
- **Build**: Compiles with warnings, HDF5 feature requires system dependencies

### Release Status
✅ Naming violations removed (enhanced/improved/optimized variants eliminated)
✅ SIMD implementation unified (removed 3 redundant modules)
⚠️ Zero-copy patterns partially implemented (clone operations remain)
⚠️ GPU acceleration infrastructure present but untested
✅ Module size targets mostly met
⚠️ Literature validation incomplete
⚠️ Test coverage insufficient

### Version 0.1 Status: **ALPHA - ARCHITECTURE REFACTORED**

### Improvements Made
- Eliminated redundant SIMD implementations (swar_enhanced, operations_improved, operations_dispatch)
- Unified SIMD module with single implementation per operation
- Fixed naming violations (removed adjective-based names)
- Consolidated architecture to follow SSOT principle
- Applied cargo fmt and cargo fix

### Known Issues
- 112 clone operations violate zero-copy promise
- GPU support untested
- HDF5 feature requires system dependencies
- Some examples may not compile
- Missing comprehensive test coverage
- Documentation incomplete
