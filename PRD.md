## Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation suite implemented in pure Rust. The suite will support 1D, 2D, and 3D simulations with a plugin/factory-based architecture to ensure extensibility and modularity. The 1D implementation will be inspired by the MMFT simulator approach, while the 3D implementation will integrate with the CSGrs crate for mesh handling.

## Project Overview

### Vision
Create a high-performance, modular, and extensible CFD simulation framework in Rust that adheres to modern software engineering principles while providing accurate and validated computational fluid dynamics capabilities across multiple dimensions.

### Goals
1. Implement a plugin-based architecture for maximum extensibility
2. Support 1D, 2D, and 3D CFD simulations
3. Ensure zero-copy/zero-cost abstractions throughout
4. Maintain clean, well-documented, and tested codebase
5. Validate all algorithms against known literature solutions
6. Integrate with existing Rust ecosystem (CSGrs for 3D meshes)

### Non-Goals
1. GUI implementation (command-line and library interface only)
2. std/no_std compatibility (focus on full implementation first)
3. Benchmarking and performance optimization (initial phase)
4. Backward compatibility maintenance
