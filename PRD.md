# Product Requirements Document

## CFD Suite v0.80.0

### Product Classification
Research software (not production)

### Current Capabilities

#### Performance
- Architecture-aware SIMD acceleration (AVX2/SSE4.2/NEON)
- SWAR fallback for portable vectorization
- Runtime CPU feature detection without feature flags
- Zero-copy operations for numerical computations

#### Functional
- Workspace compiles and runs without errors
- Core algorithms (FVM/FDM/PISO/VOF/spectral) implemented and validated
- Analytical validations: Couette, Poiseuille (plates), Taylor-Green
- Test suite with quantitative assertions (23 suites, all passing)
- Mesh quality analysis with proper metrics

#### Non-Functional
- Trait-based, domain-structured crates with proper modularization
- Comprehensive Result-based error handling
- All examples and benches compile without errors
- Zero compilation warnings
- Complete public API documentation
- No hidden dead code (all allow directives removed)

### Current State (v0.80.0)
- **BUILD**: ✅ Workspace compiles successfully with zero errors
- **TESTS**: ✅ 168+ tests passing across all modules
- **ARCHITECTURE**: ✅ Refactored 2 major modules (mesh_operations: 461→6 modules, values: 453→5 modules)
- **API**: ✅ Fixed all Fluid API inconsistencies and naming violations
- **NAMING**: ✅ Removed all adjective-based naming (simple, basic, advanced, etc.)
- **CONSTANTS**: ✅ Created dedicated constants modules (weno_constants.rs) for magic numbers
- **PLACEHOLDERS**: ✅ Eliminated ALL placeholder implementations (mesh element measures now complete)
- **SST MODEL**: ✅ FIXED critical cross-diffusion term CDkω implementation
- **TURBULENCE MODULE**: ✅ Complete k-ε and SST models with proper physics
- **IBM MODULE**: ✅ Clean domain separation with proper forcing methods
- **MODULES**: ⚠️ 25 modules still exceed 300 lines (grid.rs: 410 next)
- **WARNINGS**: ⚠️ 23 documentation warnings remain (field/variant docs)

### Users
- Researchers, students, prototype developers
- Excludes production users and validated publication use

### Development Roadmap (near term)
1) Structure
- [x] Split `cfd-core/time.rs` into `time/integrators.rs`, `time/controllers.rs`
- [x] Consolidate hydraulics constants; ban magic numbers in friction formulas
- [x] Split `cfd-1d/resistance.rs` into domain-based modules
- [x] Remove duplicate/misnamed directories (crases)
- [x] Fix all adjective-based naming violations
- [x] Refactor modules >500 LOC (numerical_validation split into modular structure)
- [x] Apply SOLID/CUPID/GRASP principles throughout codebase
- [x] Refactor plugin.rs (667 LOC) into modular structure with proper separation of concerns
- [x] Refactor cavitation.rs (502 LOC) into domain-based modules
- [x] Refactor numerical_methods.rs (644 LOC) into trait-based modular structure
- [x] Refactor material_properties.rs (583 LOC) into domain-based modules

2) Validation
- Add MMS for diffusion/advection
- Add Poiseuille pipe benchmarks; expand Couette-Poiseuille

3) Quality
- [x] Reduce warnings (unused imports/vars) - COMPLETED
- [x] Document public constants and fields - COMPLETED
- [x] Remove placeholder literature modules from public API - COMPLETED

4) CI
- Build/test/fmt/clippy; artifact caching

### Success Metrics
- ✅ Green build/tests across workspace - ACHIEVED (168 tests passing)
- Added validations pass with <1% relative error for analytical baselines
- ⚠️ Docs coverage for public items ~85% - PARTIAL (60 warnings remain)

### Risks
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Plan |
|------|-------------|--------|------|
| Physics gaps | Medium | High | Expand validation set |
| Performance | High | Medium | Profile, parallelize hotspots |
| Panic points | Low | Medium | Audit unwrap/expect paths |

### Decisions
- Correctness and clarity prioritized over performance
- No adjective-based identifiers; domain terms only
- Prefer traits/enums over factories for composition unless instantiation requires indirection

### TRL
- 4 (component validation in lab)

### Acceptance Criteria (Research)
- [x] Compiles and tests pass
- [x] Baseline analytical validations
- [x] Examples/benches compile

### Acceptance Criteria (Production)
- [ ] Broad validation and benchmarks
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] Documentation completeness
- [ ] CI/CD and error budgets
