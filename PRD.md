# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
# CFD Suite - Rust Implementation

## Version: 0.61.0
## Status: CRITICAL - Non-Functional
## Date: 2024

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING ⚠️

**This product is currently NON-OPERATIONAL due to catastrophic code corruption affecting 40+ core files.**

## Executive Summary

The CFD Suite is a comprehensive Computational Fluid Dynamics simulation package implemented in Rust. While the architecture and physics models are theoretically sound, the codebase has suffered extensive structural damage from what appears to be a failed automated refactoring, rendering it completely non-functional.

## Current State Assessment

### Critical Issues
- ❌ **Cannot Compile**: 40+ files with syntax errors
- ❌ **Cannot Test**: Build failures prevent all testing
- ❌ **Cannot Run**: No executable can be produced
- ❌ **Cannot Validate**: Physics implementations unverifiable

### Positive Aspects
- ✅ **Sound Physics Models**: Correct implementations where readable
- ✅ **Good Architecture**: Domain-driven design properly structured
- ✅ **Clean Naming**: No redundant files or bad naming patterns
- ✅ **SSOT for Constants**: Properly centralized physical constants

## Risk Assessment

### Critical Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Severity |
|------|------------|--------|----------|
| Cannot restore functionality | Medium | Project failure | CRITICAL |
| Hidden physics errors | High | Incorrect results | HIGH |
| Performance degradation | Unknown | Slow simulations | MEDIUM |
| Missing implementations | Confirmed | Limited features | HIGH |

## Recovery Plan

### Option 1: Complete Repair (Recommended)
- **Time**: 16-32 hours
- **Effort**: High
- **Result**: Full functionality
- **Risk**: May introduce new bugs

### Option 2: Partial Restoration
- **Time**: 8-16 hours
- **Effort**: Medium
- **Result**: Basic functionality
- **Risk**: Limited capabilities

### Option 3: Rewrite Core Module
- **Time**: 40-60 hours
- **Effort**: Very High
- **Result**: Clean implementation
- **Risk**: Scope creep

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Product
- [ ] All modules compile
- [ ] Basic 1D flow solver works
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] No memory leaks

### Full Product
- [ ] All physics models functional
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] >80% test coverage
- [ ] Complete documentation

## Timeline Estimate

### Phase 1: Emergency Repair (8-16 hours)
- Fix all syntax errors
- Restore compilation
- Basic functionality

### Phase 2: Validation (8-16 hours)
- Verify physics implementations
- Run test suite
- Performance profiling

### Phase 3: Completion (8-16 hours)
- Implement missing features
- Documentation
- Release preparation

**Total: 24-48 hours to full functionality**

## Recommendations

1. **IMMEDIATE ACTION**: Begin systematic repair of core module
2. **CRITICAL**: Verify physics implementations against literature
3. **IMPORTANT**: Establish comprehensive test coverage
4. **FUTURE**: Consider rewrite if repair proves inadequate

## Conclusion

The CFD Suite represents a well-architected simulation framework with sound physics models, but it is currently completely non-functional due to extensive code corruption. The project requires significant repair effort before it can be considered viable. The underlying design and physics implementations (where readable) are correct, suggesting the project is salvageable with appropriate effort.

### Overall Assessment: **D** (Non-functional)
- Architecture: B
- Physics Models: B+ (where verifiable)
- Implementation: F
- Usability: F
