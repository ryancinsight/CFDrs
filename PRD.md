- ⚠️ 20 files violating SLAP principle (>500 lines each)
- ⚠️ Performance issues from unnecessary cloning
- ⚠️ Incomplete test coverage due to compilation issues

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 System Design
The architecture follows domain-driven design principles with a modular crate structure:

```

├── cfd-core/       # Core abstractions, traits, plugin system
├── cfd-math/       # Numerical methods (25 compilation errors)
├── cfd-mesh/       # Mesh operations (needs modularization)
├── cfd-1d/         # 1D solvers (needs modularization)
├── cfd-2d/         # 2D solvers (functional)
├── cfd-3d/         # 3D solvers (functional)
├── cfd-io/         # I/O operations (functional)
└── cfd-validation/ # Testing framework (pending)
```
