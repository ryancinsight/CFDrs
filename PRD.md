## Decision Log

### Key Decisions
1. **Rust over C++**: Safety over performance
2. **Correctness over speed**: Validate first, optimize later
3. **Modular over monolithic**: Maintainability
4. **Tests over docs**: Working code first

### Trade-offs Accepted
- Performance for safety
- Features for correctness
- Speed for maintainability
- Completeness for stability

## Acceptance Criteria

### Library Release
- [x] All tests pass
- [x] No unsafe code
- [x] Physics validated
- [ ] Examples work
- [ ] Documented API

### Production Use
- [ ] Performance benchmarked
- [ ] Industrial validation
- [ ] Complete documentation
- [ ] Support structure
- [ ] Security audit

## Conclusion

The CFD Suite v9.0.0 is a **functionally correct** implementation suitable for **research and education**. It is **not recommended** for production use in safety-critical or performance-critical applications without additional validation and optimization.

### Recommendation
**APPROVE** for academic use  
**DEFER** for industrial use pending optimization
