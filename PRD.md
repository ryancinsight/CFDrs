## Development Roadmap

### Immediate Needs
1. Fix broken examples
2. Update benchmark suite
3. Complete documentation
4. Resolve warnings

### Short Term (1-3 months)
1. API stabilization
2. Example coverage
3. Performance profiling
4. Documentation completion

### Long Term (3-6 months)
1. GPU acceleration
2. MPI support
3. Advanced turbulence
4. Full validation suite

## Honest Recommendations

### For Users
- **DO**: Use core library for basic CFD
- **DO**: Run library tests for validation
- **DON'T**: Rely on all examples
- **DON'T**: Expect GPU performance

### For Developers
- **DO**: Fix examples incrementally
- **DO**: Maintain test coverage
- **DON'T**: Add features without tests
- **DON'T**: Break existing APIs

## Decision Matrix

| Factor | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Functionality | 7/10 | Core works, extras broken |
| Reliability | 8/10 | Library solid, examples weak |
| Performance | 6/10 | No optimization/GPU |
| Documentation | 6/10 | Basics covered, details missing |
| Production Ready | 5/10 | Limited use cases |

## Final Assessment

**Verdict**: Suitable for limited production use with careful scope management.

The CFD Suite provides:
- ✅ Solid core library
- ✅ Good test coverage (library)
- ⚠️ Partial example coverage
- ❌ Missing advanced features

**Recommendation**: Deploy for research and education, avoid production-critical uses until examples and benchmarks are fixed.
