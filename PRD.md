# Product Requirements Document

## CFD Suite v14.0.0 - Pragmatic Assessment

### Executive Summary
A functional CFD prototype in Rust that works for educational purposes but requires significant investment to reach production quality. All examples now compile and core functionality is demonstrated.

### Current State

| Metric | Status | Details |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Compilation | ✅ Success | All code compiles without errors |
| Tests | ✅ 221 passing | Unit tests only, no integration tests |
| Examples | ✅ 18 compile | All examples build, ~10 run successfully |
| Architecture | ❌ Poor | 18 modules violate SLAP (>600 lines) |
| Performance | ❌ Unknown | No benchmarks exist |
| Production | ❌ Not Ready | Single-threaded, unoptimized |

### What Works

**Functional Components:**
- Basic CFD algorithms (FDM, FVM, LBM, FEM)
- Linear solvers (CG, BiCGSTAB)
- Turbulence models (k-ε, Smagorinsky, Mixing Length)
- Mesh operations (CSG, quality metrics)
- Flow calculations (divergence, vorticity, enstrophy)

**Working Examples:**
- `simple_cfd_demo` - Core functionality demonstration
- `pipe_flow_1d` - 1D flow simulation
- `fem_3d_stokes` - FEM solver setup
- Several others focusing on specific features

### Critical Issues

1. **Architecture Violations**
   - 18 files exceed 600 lines (SLAP violation)
   - 3 duplicate ElementType definitions (SSOT violation)
   - Inconsistent API patterns across modules

2. **Performance Limitations**
   - Single-threaded execution only
   - No GPU support
   - No SIMD optimizations
   - Performance completely unmeasured

3. **Missing Infrastructure**
   - No integration tests
   - No benchmarks
   - No validation suite
   - Incomplete documentation (~50%)

### Competitive Reality

| Feature | This Project | OpenFOAM | SU2 |
|---------|-------------|----------|-----|
| Parallel Computing | ❌ | ✅ MPI | ✅ MPI |
| GPU Support | ❌ | ✅ CUDA | ✅ CUDA |
| Validated Physics | ⚠️ Unit tests | ✅ 30+ years | ✅ NASA |
| Performance | ❌ Unknown | ✅ Optimized | ✅ Optimized |
| Production Ready | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Documentation | ⚠️ 50% | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete |

**Gap Analysis:** This project is 5-10 years behind established solutions.

### Use Case Assessment

**Valid Use Cases:**
- Educational tool for learning Rust + CFD
- Small academic problems (<10k cells)
- Algorithm prototyping and exploration
- Code review and study

**Invalid Use Cases:**
- Production simulations
- Commercial applications
- Research requiring validated results
- Performance-critical computations
- Large-scale problems

### Development Roadmap

**Phase 1: Architecture (2-3 months)**
- Split 18 large modules into focused components
- Consolidate duplicate type definitions
- Establish consistent API patterns
- Add integration test suite

**Phase 2: Performance (3-4 months)**
- Implement parallelization with rayon
- Add comprehensive benchmark suite
- Profile and optimize critical paths
- Document performance characteristics

**Phase 3: Validation (2-3 months)**
- Compare against analytical solutions
- Validate against published benchmarks
- Document accuracy and limitations
- Create validation test suite

**Phase 4: Scale (6+ months)**
- GPU support (CUDA/ROCm)
- MPI for distributed computing
- Adaptive mesh refinement
- Industrial-strength features

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Architecture debt grows | High | High | Immediate refactoring needed |
| Performance inadequate | High | High | Benchmarks required first |
| Low adoption | High | Medium | Focus on education market |
| Maintenance burden | Medium | High | Simplify architecture |

### Resource Requirements

**To reach MVP (production-viable):**
- 2-3 full-time developers
- 6-12 months development
- Expertise in: Rust, CFD, HPC, GPU programming
- Access to HPC resources for testing

### Honest Recommendation

**Current Grade: C- (70/100)**

This project successfully demonstrates CFD concepts in Rust but is not suitable for production use. The architecture needs significant refactoring, performance is unmeasured, and it lacks the parallelization required for real problems.

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **For Users:** Use for learning only, not for real work
2. **For Maintainers:** Focus on architecture fixes before features
3. **For Investors:** Requires 6-12 months to reach MVP

### Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|---------------|
| Need production CFD | Use OpenFOAM or SU2 |
| Learning Rust + CFD | This project is suitable |
| Commercial product | Look elsewhere |
| Research project | Use validated software |
| Contributing to OSS | Good learning opportunity |

### Bottom Line

**What this is:** A functional educational prototype demonstrating CFD in Rust.

**What this isn't:** Production-ready software competitive with established solutions.

**Investment needed:** 6-12 months of focused development to reach minimum production quality.
