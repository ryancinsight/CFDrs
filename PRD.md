# Product Requirements Document

## CFD Suite v0.56.0

### Product Classification
**Research Software** - Not Production Ready

### Current Capabilities

#### Functional
- Compiles and runs CFD simulations
- Implements core algorithms (FVM, FDM, PISO, VOF)
- Provides type and memory safety via Rust
- Passes basic test suite (161 tests)

#### Non-Functional
- Clean architecture with trait-based design
- Modular crate structure
- Basic error handling with Result types
- Examples demonstrate usage

### Current Limitations

#### Critical Gaps
1. **No Physics Validation**: Results unverified against known solutions
2. **No Performance Optimization**: Single-threaded, unoptimized
3. **Limited Test Coverage**: 45% coverage, edge cases untested
4. **Potential Panics**: 107 unwrap/expect calls that could panic

#### Technical Debt
- 5 modules exceed 500 lines (violate SLAP)
- Incomplete API documentation
- No benchmarks or profiling
- No CI/CD pipeline

### User Segments

#### Target Users (Current)
- Researchers exploring CFD algorithms
- Students learning Rust + CFD
- Developers prototyping solutions

#### Non-Target Users (Current)
- Production environments
- Commercial applications
- Published research requiring validated results
- Performance-critical simulations

   - Implement MMS tests
   - Compare with analytical solutions
   - Benchmark against OpenFOAM

2. **Performance** (3 weeks)
   - Profile and identify bottlenecks
   - Implement parallelization
   - Optimize critical paths

3. **Testing** (2 weeks)
   - Achieve 80% coverage
   - Add integration tests
   - Implement property-based tests

4. **Documentation** (1 week)
   - Complete API docs
   - Add architecture guide
   - Create user manual

### Success Metrics

#### Current (Research Software)
- ✅ Builds without errors: Achieved
- ✅ Core algorithms work: Achieved
- ✅ Memory safe: Achieved
- ✅ Examples run: Achieved

#### Required for Production
- ❌ Validated accuracy: Not achieved
- ❌ Performance targets: Not defined/achieved
- ❌ 80% test coverage: Currently 45%
- ❌ Zero panics: Currently 107 potential

### Risk Matrix

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Status |
|------|------------|--------|--------|
| Incorrect physics | High | Critical | Unmitigated |
| Poor performance | Certain | High | Accepted |
| Runtime panics | Low | Medium | Identified |
| Memory issues | Very Low | High | Mitigated by Rust |

### Investment Required

**To Production (TRL 9)**: 10-12 weeks, 2-3 engineers

**ROI Analysis**: 
- Cost: ~$100-150k
- Benefit: Competing in established market
- Recommendation: Only if specific commercial need

### Technical Decisions

#### Accepted Trade-offs
1. Correctness over performance
2. Safety over optimization
3. Clarity over cleverness
4. Working code over perfect code

#### Deferred Decisions
1. Parallelization strategy
2. SIMD implementation
3. GPU acceleration
4. Distributed computing

### Quality Attributes

| Attribute | Current | Target | Gap |
|-----------|---------|--------|-----|
| Correctness | Unknown | Validated | Critical |
| Performance | Slow | Fast | Large |
| Reliability | Moderate | High | Moderate |
| Maintainability | Good | Good | None |
| Usability | Moderate | High | Moderate |

### Conclusion

CFD Suite v0.56.0 is **functional research software** that demonstrates CFD algorithms in Rust. It provides value for education and research but requires significant investment to reach production quality.

**Recommendation**: Continue as research/educational tool. Only invest in production readiness if there's a specific commercial opportunity that justifies the cost.
