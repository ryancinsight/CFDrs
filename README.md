# CFD Suite - Rust Implementation

**Version 15.0.0** - Functional CFD library with performance benchmarks and integration tests.

## Current Status

```bash
✅ Library compiles without errors
✅ 221 unit tests pass
✅ 8 integration tests added
✅ All 18 examples compile and run
✅ Performance benchmarks implemented
✅ SSOT violation fixed (ElementType consolidated)
⚠️  18 modules still violate SLAP (>600 lines)
❌ No parallelization (single-threaded)
❌ No GPU support
```

## Recent Improvements (v15.0.0)

1. **Fixed SSOT Violations**: Consolidated 3 duplicate `ElementType` definitions into single source
2. **Added Performance Benchmarks**: Comprehensive benchmarks for flow operations, linear solvers, memory patterns
3. **Added Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow tests verifying component interactions
4. **Fixed Build Issues**: Removed broken validation_suite reference

## What Works

```bash
# Build everything
cargo build --workspace --all-targets  # ✅ Compiles successfully

# Run tests
cargo test --workspace --lib           # ✅ 221 unit tests pass
cargo test integration_tests           # ✅ 8 integration tests pass

# Run benchmarks
cargo bench                            # ✅ Performance measurements available

# Run examples
cargo run --example simple_cfd_demo    # ✅ Works
cargo run --example pipe_flow_1d       # ✅ Works
cargo run --example fem_3d_stokes      # ✅ Works
```

## Performance Benchmarks

Now we have actual performance data:

```bash
cargo bench
```

Measures:
- Flow field operations (divergence, vorticity, kinetic energy)
- Linear solver performance (Conjugate Gradient)
- Memory allocation patterns
- Scaling behavior with problem size

## Architecture Issues (Still Present)

### SLAP Violations (18 files > 600 lines)
```
cfd-io/src/vtk.rs: 718 lines
cfd-validation/src/convergence.rs: 695 lines
cfd-mesh/src/csg.rs: 693 lines
cfd-math/src/iterators.rs: 693 lines
... and 14 more
```

**These still need to be split into smaller, focused modules.**

## Performance Characteristics

Based on benchmarks:
- **Single-threaded only** - No parallelization
- **Memory efficient** - Uses sparse matrices where appropriate
- **Scaling** - O(n³) for 3D operations (as expected)
- **No SIMD** - Missing vectorization opportunities

## Use Cases

### Appropriate For
- Learning Rust + CFD concepts
- Small academic problems (<100k cells)
- Algorithm prototyping
- Educational demonstrations
- Performance baseline measurements

### NOT Appropriate For
- Production systems
- Large-scale simulations (>1M cells)
- Real-time applications
- Commercial projects

## Grade: C+ (75/100)

### Improvements from v14
- ✅ SSOT violations fixed (+5)
- ✅ Benchmarks added (+5)
- ✅ Integration tests added (+5)
- ❌ Large modules not split (-10)

| Aspect | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Functionality | 80% | Core features work with tests |
| Architecture | 45% | SSOT fixed but 18 SLAP violations remain |
| Testing | 75% | Unit + integration tests |
| Performance | 20% | Measured but not optimized |
| Documentation | 60% | Improving |

## Next Priority: Architecture Refactoring

The 18 modules >600 lines MUST be split:

1. **cfd-io/src/vtk.rs** (718 lines) → Split into reader/writer/types
2. **cfd-validation/src/convergence.rs** (695 lines) → Split by convergence criteria
3. **cfd-mesh/src/csg.rs** (693 lines) → Split operations from primitives
4. **cfd-math/src/iterators.rs** (693 lines) → Split by iterator type
5. **cfd-validation/src/error_metrics.rs** (682 lines) → Split by metric category

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository>
cd cfd-suite

# Build
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run benchmarks
cargo bench

# Try examples
cargo run --example simple_cfd_demo
```

## Contributing

Priority areas:
1. **Architecture**: Split large modules (>600 lines)
2. **Performance**: Add parallelization with rayon
3. **Documentation**: Complete API docs
4. **Validation**: Add comparison with analytical solutions
