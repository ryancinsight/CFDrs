```

### Design Principles Applied
- **SSOT/SPOT**: Single Source of Truth via unified prelude
- **SOLID**: Interface segregation and dependency inversion
- **CUPID**: Composable plugins and traits
- **GRASP**: High cohesion, low coupling
- **DRY**: No duplicate implementations
- **Clean Code**: Descriptive naming, no adjectives in names

## 🔧 Recent Improvements

### Completed Refactoring
- ✅ Removed all adjective-based naming (166 instances fixed)
- ✅ Replaced temporal variables (`*_old`, `*_new`) with descriptive names
- ✅ Reorganized cfd-2d into domain-based modules
- ✅ Replaced magic numbers with named constants
- ✅ Removed duplicate examples
- ✅ Fixed API inconsistencies

### Code Quality Enhancements
- Proper module hierarchy following domain boundaries
- Constants module with physics and numerical constants
- Zero-copy techniques and iterator usage where applicable
- Trait-based abstractions for extensibility

## 🚀 Building the Project

```bash
# Build all crates
cargo build --workspace

# Run tests
cargo test --workspace --lib

# Build specific examples (currently working)
cargo build --example pipe_flow_validation
cargo build --example scheme_integration_demo
cargo build --example spectral_performance
```

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Technical Debt Remaining
- Some examples need API updates (15 of 18 not compiling)
- Placeholder implementations in validation module
- Incomplete CSG integration features
- Some physics models need literature validation

### Areas for Improvement
- Complete implementation of all turbulence models
- Full 3D solver implementation
- Performance optimization and benchmarking
- Comprehensive documentation

## 💡 Usage

```rust
use cfd_suite::prelude::*;

// Create a fluid
let fluid = Fluid::<f64>::water()?;

// Build a 1D network
let network = NetworkBuilder::new(fluid)
    .add_node(Node::new(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0))
    .build()?;

// Create a 2D grid
let grid = StructuredGrid2D::new(100, 100, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0);

// Set up a solver
let solver = FvmSolver::new(FvmConfig::default());
```
