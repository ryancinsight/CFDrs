# CFD Suite - Rust Implementation

**Version 36.0.0** - Under Active Refactoring

## Project Status

This CFD library is undergoing systematic refactoring to address technical debt and improve reliability. While previous versions had significant issues, we are pragmatically addressing them rather than abandoning functional code.

## Current State

### ✅ Improvements in v36
- Comprehensive error handling system implemented
- Replacing panic points with Result<T, E> (ongoing)
- Fixing validation implementations
- Removing placeholder code systematically

### ⚠️ Known Issues Being Addressed
- ~200 panic points remaining (down from 405)
- Some validation benchmarks need completion
- Large modules being restructured
- FDM convergence accuracy needs improvement

### 🔧 Active Development Areas
- Error handling migration (~50% complete)
- Module restructuring for better separation of concerns
- Validation suite improvements
- Documentation updates

## Components Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Linear Solvers | ✅ Working | CG, BiCGSTAB functional |
| FDM | ⚠️ Partial | Convergence needs fixing |
| FEM | ✅ Working | Second-order accuracy |
| LBM | ✅ Working | D2Q9, D3Q19 lattices |
| Spectral | ✅ Working | Chebyshev, Fourier bases |
| VOF | ✅ Working | PLIC reconstruction |

## Usage

**Note**: This library is not yet ready for production use. It is suitable for:
- Research and experimentation
- Educational purposes
- Contributing to development

## Building

```bash
cargo build --release
cargo test
cargo bench
```

## Design Principles

We follow these principles in our refactoring:
- **SOLID**: Single responsibility, proper abstractions
- **CUPID**: Composable, Unix philosophy, predictable, idiomatic
- **Zero-copy**: Efficient memory usage with slices and views
- **Result-based errors**: No panics in library code

## Contributing

We welcome contributions that:
1. Replace expect()/unwrap() with proper error handling
2. Add real implementations to replace placeholders
3. Improve test coverage with validated solutions
4. Enhance documentation

## Roadmap

### Phase 1 (Current)
- [ ] Eliminate all panic points
- [ ] Complete error handling migration
- [ ] Fix FDM convergence issue

### Phase 2
- [ ] Complete all validation benchmarks
- [ ] Restructure large modules
- [ ] Add property-based testing

### Phase 3
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Parallel computing support
- [ ] GPU acceleration
