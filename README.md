    let mut solver = LevelSetSolver::new(config, nx, ny, nz, dx, dx, dx);
    
    // Initialize with a bubble
    solver.initialize_sphere(Vector3::new(0.5, 0.5, 0.5), 0.2);
    
    // Set velocity field (e.g., from Navier-Stokes solver)
    let velocity = compute_velocity_field();
    solver.set_velocity(velocity);
