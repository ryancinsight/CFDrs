# CFD Suite - Rust Implementation

**Version 0.57.5** - Research Software

## ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### Major Problems Found During Deep Review:

1. **Dangerous Numeric Conversions**: 124+ instances of using `T::zero()` as fallback for critical constants like PI, which causes silent mathematical errors
2. **Incorrect Physics**: "Simplified" implementations that don't solve real equations (e.g., Gauss-Seidel in step.rs is just a Laplacian smoother, not a CFD solver)
3. **Unphysical Terms**: Artificial damping and stabilization that violates conservation laws
4. **Magic Numbers**: Still present despite claims of removal (0.7, 0.95, 4.0, 6.0, etc.)
5. **Module Size Violations**: level_set.rs (713 LOC), numerical_validation.rs (721 LOC) exceed limits

## Status

- Builds with errors due to ongoing refactoring
- Many physics implementations are incorrect or oversimplified
- Numeric safety issues throughout codebase
- Architecture partially improved but needs completion

## Verified Functionality
- ✅ Memory safe (Rust guarantees)
- ✅ Modular architecture started
- ⚠️ Build partially succeeds
- ❌ Physics correctness NOT verified
- ❌ Numerical methods contain errors
- ❌ Safe numeric conversions NOT implemented

## Technical Improvements (v0.57.5 - In Progress)
- Started splitting large modules (level_set partially done)
- Created safe numeric conversion module (cfd-core::numeric)
- Fixed some adjective-based naming
- Identified and documented critical issues
- Proper SIMPLE algorithm implementation for step.rs (replacing incorrect version)

## Architecture
```
cfd-suite/
├── cfd-core/       # Core with NEW numeric safety module
├── cfd-math/       # Numerical methods (needs InvalidValue fixes)
├── cfd-mesh/       # Mesh, grid, quality
├── cfd-1d/         # 1D networks with modular resistance
├── cfd-2d/         # 2D fields (has physics errors)
├── cfd-3d/         # 3D with partially split level_set
├── cfd-io/         # I/O
└── cfd-validation/ # Contains INCORRECT "simplified" implementations
```

## Critical Work Required

### Immediate Priority
1. Replace ALL `unwrap_or_else(|| T::zero())` with proper error handling
2. Fix incorrect physics in benchmarks/step.rs
3. Remove artificial damping/stabilization terms
4. Complete module splitting for large files
5. Replace remaining magic numbers with constants

### Physics Corrections Needed
- Gauss-Seidel must solve actual momentum equations
- Remove v-velocity damping (line 95 in step.rs)
- Implement proper SIMPLE/PISO algorithms
- Validate against literature (currently fails)

## Design Principles (Partially Achieved)
- **SSOT/SPOT**: ⚠️ Violated by magic numbers
- **Error Handling**: ❌ Dangerous fallbacks to zero
- **Physics Accuracy**: ❌ Simplified/incorrect implementations
- **Clean Architecture**: ⚠️ In progress
- **Zero-copy**: ✅ Where implemented

## Validation Status
- ❌ Analytical solutions compromised by numeric errors
- ❌ "Simplified" implementations don't match real physics
- ❌ Literature validation would fail
- ⚠️ Test suite may pass but tests incorrect physics

## Known Critical Bugs
1. PI converted to zero on conversion failure
2. Gauss-Seidel doesn't solve Navier-Stokes
3. Artificial damping violates momentum conservation
4. Magic numbers in critical calculations
5. Error enum refactoring incomplete

## TRL
- TRL 2 (technology concept - many components incorrect)
- NOT suitable for research use until issues fixed

## ⚠️ WARNING
This codebase contains significant physics and numerical errors that must be corrected before any scientific use. The "simplified" implementations are mathematically incorrect and will produce invalid results.
