## Usage
```
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace --all-targets
cargo run --example pipe_flow_1d --release
```

## Design Principles
- SSOT/SPOT: constants centralized; replace magic numbers with named constants
- SOLID/CUPID/GRASP/SLAP/DRY/CLEAN: traits for composition; avoid mixing concerns
- No adjective-bearing identifiers in APIs (ban subjective names); use domain terms

## Validation
- Analytical: Couette, Poiseuille (plates), Taylor-Green initial/decay
- Numerical: linear solver convergence tests and criteria
- Literature placeholder entries removed from public API until validated
- CSG external API examples removed; CSG feature remains stubbed behind feature flag
- Add manufactured solutions and benchmark comparisons next

## Limits (non-exhaustive)
- Limited validation coverage beyond listed cases
- Performance and parallelism not targeted yet
- Missing docs for some public items

## TRL
- TRL 4 (component validation in lab environment)
