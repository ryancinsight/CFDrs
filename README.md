# CFD Suite - Rust Implementation

**Version 0.61.0** - Stable Working Version

## Status: OPERATIONAL ✅

We've reverted to a known working state (commit `bc5bf29`) after encountering systematic corruption in recent refactoring attempts. This version:
- **Builds successfully** across all modules
- **All tests pass** 
- **Architecture is sound**

## Current State

### What's Working ✅
- Complete multi-dimensional CFD framework (1D, 2D, 3D)
- Core abstractions and plugin system
- Mathematical operations and linear solvers
- Mesh generation and quality assessment
- I/O operations (VTK, HDF5, CSV)
- Validation benchmarks and analytical solutions

### Build Status
```bash
cargo build --workspace  # Builds successfully with documentation warnings
cargo test --workspace   # All tests pass
```

## Architecture

The codebase follows a modular, domain-driven design:

```
cfd-suite/
├── cfd-core/       # Core abstractions, traits, and plugin system
├── cfd-math/       # Mathematical operations and numerical methods
├── cfd-mesh/       # Mesh generation and manipulation
├── cfd-1d/         # 1D solvers (pipe networks, microfluidics)
├── cfd-2d/         # 2D solvers (FDM, FVM, LBM)
├── cfd-3d/         # 3D solvers (FEM, spectral methods)
├── cfd-io/         # Input/output operations
└── cfd-validation/ # Benchmarks and validation
```

## Key Features

### 1D Solvers
- Pipe network analysis
- Microfluidic device simulation
- Channel flow with various resistance models
- Component-based system modeling (pumps, valves, mixers)

### 2D Solvers
- Finite Difference Method (FDM)
- Finite Volume Method (FVM)
- Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM)
- SIMPLE/PISO algorithms for pressure-velocity coupling
- Various discretization schemes (upwind, central, WENO, TVD)

### 3D Solvers
- Finite Element Method (FEM)
- Spectral methods (Fourier, Chebyshev)
- Volume of Fluid (VOF) for multiphase flows
- Level Set methods
- Immersed Boundary Method (IBM)

### Physics Models
- Navier-Stokes equations
- Heat transfer
- Turbulence models (k-ε, k-ω SST)
- Multiphase flows
- Non-Newtonian fluids

## Design Principles

The codebase adheres to:
- **SOLID** principles for maintainable architecture
- **Zero-copy** patterns for performance
- **Type safety** with Rust's type system
- **Error handling** with Result types
- **Modularity** through trait-based abstractions

## Usage

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
cfd-suite = { path = "path/to/cfd-suite" }
```

Basic example:
```rust
use cfd_suite::prelude::*;

// Your CFD simulation code here
```

## Development Plan

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Documentation**: Add missing documentation to eliminate warnings
2. **Code Quality**: Review and enhance design patterns
3. **Constants**: Replace remaining magic numbers with named constants
4. **Testing**: Expand test coverage

### Future Enhancements
- Performance optimizations
- Additional physics models
- GPU acceleration support
- Advanced turbulence models

**Note**: This is a stable working version. Previous attempts at automated refactoring introduced systematic corruption. We're proceeding with careful, incremental improvements from this known-good state.
