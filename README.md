## Architecture Highlights

### 2D Solver Capabilities

#### SIMPLE (Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure-Linked Equations)
- Pressure-velocity coupling with under-relaxation
- Convergence checking based on continuity and momentum residuals
- Suitable for steady-state problems

#### PISO (Pressure-Implicit with Splitting of Operators)
- Multiple corrector steps (typically 2)
- No under-relaxation needed
- Superior for transient simulations
- Reference: Issa (1986)

#### Vorticity-Stream Function
- Eliminates pressure from the equations
- Automatically satisfies continuity
- Reduced computational cost (2 variables instead of 3)
- Ideal for 2D incompressible flows

### Design Principles Applied

- **SSOT (Single Source of Truth)**: Configuration centralized in base configs
- **SOLID**: Each solver has single responsibility, open for extension
- **Zero-copy**: Extensive use of iterators and references
- **Named Constants**: All magic numbers replaced with descriptive constants
- **DRY**: Shared functionality in traits and base implementations
- **KISS**: Simple, clear implementations with extensive documentation

    let reynolds = 1000.0;
    
    // Using PISO solver
    let piso_config = PisoConfig::default();
    let mut piso = PisoSolver::new(piso_config, &grid, 1.0, 1.0/reynolds);
    piso.initialize(Vector2::zeros(), 0.0)?;
    
    // Using Vorticity-Stream solver
    let vs_config = VorticityStreamConfig::default();
    let mut vs_solver = VorticityStreamSolver::new(vs_config, &grid, reynolds);
    vs_solver.initialize_lid_driven_cavity(1.0)?;
    
    // Run simulation
    for _ in 0..1000 {
        vs_solver.step()?;
