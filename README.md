$ cargo run --example simple_cfd_demo

=== Simple CFD Demonstration ===
✓ Flow field created: 32x32x32 grid
✓ Turbulence model initialized
✓ Average turbulent viscosity: 0.000e0
✓ Divergence computed (should be ~0 for incompressible)
✓ Vorticity computed: 32768 points
✓ Kinetic energy computed: 0.000e0
✓ Reynolds number: Re=2300 (transitional)
✓ Sparse matrix: 7 non-zero elements
✓ Linear system solved: norm=1.732051
```

## API Usage

```rust
// This code is from the working example
use cfd_core::domains::fluid_dynamics::{
    FlowField, KEpsilonModel, TurbulenceModel, FlowOperations
};
use cfd_math::linear_solver::{LinearSolver, ConjugateGradient};
use cfd_math::sparse::SparseMatrixBuilder;

// Create flow field
let flow_field = FlowField::<f64>::new(32, 32, 32);

// Initialize turbulence model
let mut k_epsilon = KEpsilonModel::new();
k_epsilon.initialize_state(&flow_field);
let nu_t = k_epsilon.turbulent_viscosity(&flow_field);

// Compute flow quantities
let divergence = FlowOperations::divergence(&flow_field.velocity);
let vorticity = FlowOperations::vorticity(&flow_field.velocity);

// Solve linear system
let solver = ConjugateGradient::<f64>::default();
let x = solver.solve(&matrix, &b, None)?;
```
