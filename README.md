## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

This codebase is **NOT production-ready**. While the core algorithms are correctly implemented according to literature references, there are significant issues:

- **Validation module completely broken** - Cannot verify numerical accuracy
- **Test coverage insufficient** (~40% estimated)
- **Examples may not compile** due to validation module dependency
- **Multiple warnings** in working modules
- **Large monolithic files** violating single responsibility principle

## üî¨ Physics Implementations

The following algorithms have been implemented and appear correct based on code review:

### Validated Against Literature
- **Rhie-Chow Interpolation** (Rhie & Chow 1983) - Pressure-velocity coupling
- **PISO Algorithm** (Issa 1986) - Pressure-implicit split-operator method
- **LBM D2Q9** (Succi 2001) - Lattice Boltzmann method with D2Q9 lattice
- **FEM** (Hughes 2000) - Finite element methods
- **Level Set** (Osher & Sethian 1988) - Interface tracking

### Constants Module
Well-defined physics constants with literature references, implementing Single Source of Truth (SSOT) principle.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Strengths
- Clean separation of concerns with dedicated crates
- Trait-based abstractions for extensibility
- Zero-copy operations where possible
- Proper use of Rust's type system

### Weaknesses
- Plugin system needs better composability
- Some files exceed 800 lines (analysis.rs, channel.rs, lbm.rs)
- Incomplete generic implementations (phantom data fields)
- Magic numbers still present in some modules

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70+ (latest stable recommended)
- Cargo

### Building

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cfd-suite
cd cfd-suite

# Build working modules only (excluding validation)
cargo build --workspace --exclude cfd-validation

# Build specific modules
cargo build -p cfd-core
cargo build -p cfd-1d
cargo build -p cfd-2d
cargo build -p cfd-3d
```

### Running Tests

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note: Tests may not compile due to various issues**

```bash
# Attempt to run tests (may fail)
cargo test --workspace --exclude cfd-validation --lib
```

## üìä Code Quality Metrics

| Metric | Status | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Compilation | 75% | 100% | Validation module broken |
| Core Functionality | ~90% | 100% | Most algorithms implemented |
| Test Coverage | ~40% | >80% | Insufficient for production |
| Documentation | ~70% | 100% | Missing in some modules |
| Warnings | 100+ | 0 | Many unused variables and missing docs |

## üîß Known Issues

### Critical
1. **cfd-validation module** - 48 compilation errors, primarily move semantics and missing trait bounds
2. **Test compilation failures** - Factory tests and others don't compile
3. **Example compilation** - Many examples depend on broken validation module

### Major
1. **Large files** - Several files >500 lines need splitting:
   - `cfd-1d/src/channel.rs` (800 lines)
   - `cfd-2d/src/lbm.rs` (754 lines)
   - `cfd-math/src/differentiation.rs` (714 lines)

### Minor
1. **Warnings** - 100+ warnings for unused variables, missing documentation
2. **Magic numbers** - Some inline constants should use named constants
3. **Incomplete implementations** - `_phantom` fields suggest incomplete generics

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Roadmap

### Immediate Priority
- [ ] Fix cfd-validation compilation errors
- [ ] Fix test compilation errors
- [ ] Ensure examples compile and run

### Short Term
- [ ] Split large files into domain modules
- [ ] Increase test coverage to >80%
- [ ] Remove all compilation warnings
- [ ] Replace magic numbers with constants

### Long Term
- [ ] Implement proper plugin architecture
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Documentation completion
