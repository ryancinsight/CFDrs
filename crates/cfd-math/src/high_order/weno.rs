//! Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) schemes.
//!
//! This module provides high-order accurate shock-capturing schemes for solving
//! hyperbolic conservation laws. WENO schemes are designed to achieve high-order
//! accuracy in smooth regions while maintaining stability and non-oscillatory
//! behavior near discontinuities.
//!
//! Currently a stub implementation - WENO functionality is planned for future development.

// Placeholder for WENO implementations
// These will be implemented when WENO schemes are added
