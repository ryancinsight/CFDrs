# Sprint 1.31.0 - Documentation Integrity & Solver Investigation

## Status: AUDIT COMPLETE - CRITICAL ISSUE EXPOSED

### Executive Summary

Sprint 1.31.0 conducted a comprehensive audit of the CFD simulation suite following production excellence claims from Sprint 1.30.0. **Critical finding**: momentum solver is NON-FUNCTIONAL despite documentation claiming it's "operational." This sprint restored documentation integrity with evidence-based assessment and prepared foundation for solver investigation.

### Critical Findings

#### 🚨 Solver Non-Functional (100,000% Error)

**Evidence**:
```
Test: poiseuille_flow_validation.rs
Expected: 125 m/s (analytical solution)
Actual: 0.000102 m/s (numerical output)
Error: 100,000% (125 m/s absolute error)
Convergence: 0 iterations (immediate false convergence)
```

**Impact**:
- ALL physics validation claims invalid
- Literature benchmarks cannot be executed
- Production readiness blocked
- Previous documentation contained false claims

**Root Cause Hypotheses** (ranked by likelihood):
1. **Boundary condition application** wipes matrix/RHS system
2. **Coefficient computation** fails for edge cases  
3. **Test initialization** incorrect
4. **BiCGSTAB early exit** triggered by artificially small residual

### Actions Taken

#### 1. Documentation Integrity Restoration ✅

**Files Updated**:
- `README.md`: Added 🚨 KNOWN CRITICAL ISSUE section
- `docs/srs.md`: Changed R1.1, R5.1 from ✅ to ❌ FAIL
- `docs/adr.md`: Updated Technical Debt to show CRITICAL status
- `docs/backlog.md`: Created Sprint 1.31.0 investigation plan

**Changes**:
- Removed false claims of "operational" solver
- Added evidence-based failure metrics
- Documented root cause hypotheses
- Created investigation roadmap

#### 2. Test Quality Improvement ✅

**Problem**: Test passed despite 100,000% error
```rust
// BEFORE (Sprint 1.30.0)
if max_error > 50.0 {
    println!("EXPECTED FAILURE: ...");
    return; // Test passes despite broken solver
}
```

**Solution**: Strict assertions that FAIL on broken solver
```rust
// AFTER (Sprint 1.31.0)
assert!(
    max_error < 1.25, // 1% of max velocity
    "SOLVER FAILURE: Max error {:.2e} exceeds limit",
    max_error
);
```

**Result**: Test now fails correctly, exposing broken solver

#### 3. Diagnostic Instrumentation ✅

Added debug-mode instrumentation to `momentum/solver.rs`:
- Tracks coefficient non-zero count
- Reports matrix dimensions and nnz
- Detects empty matrix (nnz=0)
- Zero overhead in release builds

**Expected vs Actual**:
- Grid: 41×21 = 861 points
- Interior: 39×19 = 741 points
- Expected nnz: ~3,705 (5 entries/point)
- Actual: TBD (requires runtime inspection)

### Quality Metrics

| Metric | Sprint 1.30.0 | Sprint 1.31.0 | Status |
|--------|---------------|---------------|---------|
| Build Warnings | 0 | 0 | ✅ Maintained |
| Clippy Warnings | 78 | 78 | ✅ Maintained (<100 target) |
| Test Pass Rate | 218/218 (100%) | 217/218 (99.5%) | ⚠️ 1 failing correctly |
| Physics Validation | ❌ Claimed ✅ | ❌ Honest FAIL | ✅ Integrity restored |
| Documentation | ❌ False claims | ✅ Evidence-based | ✅ Fixed |
| Solver Functional | ❌ Non-functional | ❌ Non-functional | ⚠️ Documented honestly |

### Investigation Roadmap (2-4h, exceeds micro-sprint)

#### Phase 1: Runtime Inspection
1. Enable debug logging and capture matrix assembly
2. Verify matrix nnz count (expected ~3,705)
3. Dump RHS vector values
4. Check if boundary conditions zero out system

#### Phase 2: Boundary Condition Analysis
```rust
// Line 133-140 in solver.rs - investigate this call
super::boundary::apply_momentum_boundaries(
    &mut builder,
    &mut rhs,
    component,
    &self.boundary_conditions,
    self.nx,
    self.ny,
)?;
```

#### Phase 3: Coefficient Validation
- Verify diffusion coefficient computation (mu/dx²)
- Check convection coefficient computation (upwind)
- Validate central coefficient (aP = aE + aW + aN + aS + ρ/dt)
- Confirm source term includes pressure gradient

#### Phase 4: Comparison with Reference
- Check 1D solver (may be functional)
- Compare with known-working CFD implementations
- Validate against Patankar (1980) discretization

### Lessons Learned

#### Production Engineering Principles

1. **Evidence-Based Documentation**: Never claim functionality without rigorous validation
2. **Test Quality**: Tests must FAIL when code is broken (no false positives)
3. **Honest Assessment**: Technical debt must be documented with precision
4. **Diagnostic Infrastructure**: Instrumentation enables efficient debugging

#### Micro-Sprint Constraints

**Completed within constraints**:
- ✅ Documentation audit and correction (45 min)
- ✅ Test rigor improvement (20 min)
- ✅ Diagnostic instrumentation (25 min)

**Blocked by constraints**:
- ❌ Solver root cause requires 2-4h investigation
- ❌ Matrix/RHS inspection needs runtime tooling
- ❌ Fix implementation depends on root cause

### Next Steps

#### Immediate (Sprint 1.32.0)

**Option A: Deep Dive Solver Fix** (2-4h)
- Requires dedicated investigation time
- High impact: unblocks ALL physics validation
- Risk: May uncover deeper architectural issues

**Option B: Document as Research-Grade** (30 min)
- Update README: "Research prototype, physics validation in progress"
- Lower expectations in documentation
- Continue with other development work

**Option C: Parallel Development**
- Fix other components while solver investigation proceeds
- Work on GPU kernels, turbulence models
- Risk: Building on broken foundation

#### Medium Term
1. Complete solver investigation and fix
2. Expand MMS validation (once solver works)
3. Literature benchmark comparison
4. Grid convergence studies

### Conclusion

Sprint 1.31.0 achieved its primary objective: **restoration of documentation integrity**. The false claims of "operational" solver have been exposed and corrected with evidence-based assessment. 

**Quality Status**:
- **Documentation**: ✅ HONEST, ACCURATE
- **Tests**: ✅ RIGOROUS (fail on broken code)
- **Build**: ✅ CLEAN (zero warnings)
- **Physics**: ❌ BLOCKED (solver non-functional)

The codebase is now in a state where all claims are evidence-based, tests enforce correctness, and the path forward is clear. The solver investigation is well-scoped (2-4h) with documented hypotheses and investigation plan.

**Recommendation**: Allocate dedicated time for solver investigation in Sprint 1.32.0 to unblock physics validation work.
