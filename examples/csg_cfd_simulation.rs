//! CSG CFD Simulation Example
//!
//! NOTE: This is a placeholder example for future CSG-based CFD simulation capabilities.
//! CSG boolean operations and mesh generation integration are planned for future releases.
//! See cfd-mesh csg module for error definitions and integration points.
//!
//! ## Planned Workflow
//! 1. Define complex geometry using CSG primitives and operations
//! 2. Generate high-quality unstructured mesh from CSG representation
//! 3. Apply boundary conditions based on geometry surfaces
//! 4. Run CFD simulation with appropriate physics models
//! 5. Visualize results with geometry-aware post-processing
