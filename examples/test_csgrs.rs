//! Test example to understand csgrs API

fn main() {
    // Check if csgrs is available
    println!("Testing csgrs availability...");

    // NOTE: The csgrs crate API compatibility test.
    // This example tests external crate integration. API incompatibility suggests
    // the csgrs crate may have changed. This is optional visualization functionality.
    // This is likely because:
    // 1. The crate name might be different
    // 2. The API has changed
    // 3. It needs different imports

    println!("csgrs integration is not working - API incompatibility");
