//! Test example to understand csgrs API

fn main() {
    // Check if csgrs is available
    println!("Testing csgrs availability...");

    // The csgrs crate doesn't seem to be available with the expected API
    // TODO: This is likely because of API incompatibility issues
    // DEPENDENCIES: Update csgrs crate integration or find alternative
    // BLOCKED BY: API changes in external csgrs crate
    // PRIORITY: Low - Optional 2D schematic visualization
    // This is likely because:
    // 1. The crate name might be different
    // 2. The API has changed
    // 3. It needs different imports

    println!("csgrs integration is not working - API incompatibility");
